# Continous Integration:
1. Building the code.
2. Packing the application 
3. Running basic automated tests which well the health of the application.

# Agile ways of working:
------------------------
1. There is a need to release application frequently fixing the bugs and the changes based on the requirement.
2. The need for automating releses increased.
3. In Agile, we list out all the {USER STORIES} needed to be done as Product Backlog.

# Azure DevOps Pipeline:
------------------------
1. Tool for managing continous integrations as well as deployments (releases) to the customer.
2. A tool where developers can submit the code
3. A tool for managing the project

# Things we need
* GitHub account
* From my understanding we will create the Azure DevOps account using GitHub
* In azure devops we create the project 
    -> In side the project you are able to see the

             v) Queries
             vi) Delivery Plans
        b) Repos: This is where developers commit/coloborate code
            i) Files:
            ii) Commits:
            iii) Pushes:
            iv) Branches:

            vi) Pull Requests:
        c) Pipelines: This is service where CI/CD Pipelines are managed
             * In these are two types of Pipelines
                a) Build Pipeline
                b) Release Pipeline
             * Inside the Pipeline we have
                 i) Pipelines
                 ii) Environments
                 iii) Releases
                 iv) Library
                 v) Task group
                 vi) Deployment groups
        d) Test Plans: This service manage test cases and test executions
             i) Test plans
             ii) Progress report
             iii) Runs
        e) Artifacts: This service manage build artifacts
